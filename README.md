Our Spaghetti who art in meat sauce, flying be thy way. 
Thy meatballs come, thy Noodling done, on earth as it is inside us.  
Give us this day our bolognaise and forgive us our pizzas, as we forgive those who eat pizza before us and lead us not to the salad bar but deliver us from tofu.  
For thine is the gnocchi,  
The penne and linguine,  
Forever and ever.  

R'amen.
